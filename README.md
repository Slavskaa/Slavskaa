- 👋 Hi, I’m @Slavskaa, a not-so-professional young programmer (actually nothing professional)
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end, mostly. I like to practice by programming personal websites or exercices... I'll start to do them, heh
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing specific, but I'm looking fowarward on learning C# and Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... well, whatever opportunity
- 📫 How to reach me: you can contact me through GitHub (ever heard 'bout this one? :o) or my Instagram, @Slavskaa__ (it's my art account, but I'm very active over there)
- 😄 Pronouns: yo/gurt
- ⚡ Fun fact: I don't have fun facts
